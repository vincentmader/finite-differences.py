* Finite Differences

In this small python project, various different methods 
of derivative discretization are compared.

*** Setup
To run the code, you need to have `python3` installed on your machine. 

If you also have the `make` CLI tool, you can run the 
project by executing the following two commands:
#+begin_src
make setup
make fd
#+end_src

If you don't, you can also navigate to the `./bin/` 
directory and execute the two binaries manually from there.
#+begin_src
cd ./bin
./setup
./run
#+end_src
